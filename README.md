1. Linear Algebra in Information Retrieval.

The project shows implementation of Vector Space Model,Term Document Matrix,Query Matching for documents, Matrix Factorisation methods like QR, Relavance Feedback. 
The intent was to show the various applications of Linear Alegbra in Information Retrieval. The code also contains a primer on word2vec one of the techniques to vectorise text.
